# FantasyForum

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.7.

## About
This application is geared to those creative minds that enjoy storymaking and campaign making within the fantasy genre. It is also open for others to come enjoy what others have written and even critique those posts to help evolve what the author has written. Users will be able to create, view, update, and delete their own posts and view others' posts. Users will also be able to comment on other's posts

## Possible future additions
Stretch goals include (in no particular order): the ability to view and friend/follow other users, the ability to like posts, a random creature generator, a D&D item customizer, a search feature calling on the [D&D 5e API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/), and the addition of profile pictures.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
